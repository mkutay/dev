# The Deterministic Blog

I started a blog to post what comes to my mind called Deterministic Blog. And this repository is for hosting the website for the blog.
I plan to finalize this Jekyll theme and publish it officially. Until then you can use this theme by yourself by forking this repository 
and setting up GitHub Pages on your fork.
