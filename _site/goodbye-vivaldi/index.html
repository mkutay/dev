  <p>I did not think that I would say this, but I think it is time to say goodbye to Vivaldi. For those who do not know what <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> is, it is a web browser based on privacy and user power, and do please check it out as it is a great browser for anyone, but, as I will discuss, it is not for me.</p>

<p>I started using Vivaldi around two years ago, but after some time, I switched Vivaldi to <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a>. After using Firefox for a really long time, I decided to switch back to Vivaldi because apparently they solved most of the issues I had with Vivaldi back when I first switched from it, and they also had a mail client built into the browser. “I mean, how cool is that?” was my first impression of it, and for a couple of months, 5.5 months to be exact, I was very pleased with it, and I used the mail client so much that even with the performance issues that I faced with Vivaldi, I did not care about them and continued to use Vivaldi for the mail client. As you can see, the mail client was such a big productivity boost for my workflow, as I did not need to open tabs for different mail accounts and mail providers, or I did not need another application running in the background only for mail; I could just use my browser for all of that, and more.</p>

<p>After all of that, however, the mail client started to lag out, and when I tried to open it, it only then opened after 10 seconds of waiting while the whole application froze, and when I tried to close the client, it would again lag out, and I could not do anything; I mean, it was at a point that I started using Gmail’s own mail website instead of the built-in mail client. Moreover, when I tried to open a link from an email I got, I still had to wait so much time before I was even able to look through the link, and when I needed to go back to the mail, I still had to wait for an annoyingly long time.</p>

<p>So, I decided to go back to Firefox, and I could not have been more happy with my decision. I cannot believe that it is <em>this fast</em> and tactile. There is that much of a difference that I started to notice small things happening so much quicker on Firefox instead of on Vivaldi, which I was so used to. I was also able to get the customization I got on Vivaldi with Firefox’s custom user CSS. I now use <a href="https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade">Cascade</a> customization on Firefox, and I really enjoy it. As for my main reason for not switching to Firefox for a really long time, the built-in mail client of Vivaldi, I now use Apple’s own mail application. I mean, it is cumbersome, but it gets the job done, and I can say that it is much faster than Vivaldi’s own mail client.</p>

<p>In conclusion, get what you will with this story. Use Vivaldi or Firefox. Both of them are <strong><em>great</em></strong> browsers, but they are for different people. I personally like Firefox better, but Vivaldi’s team’s work is actually great for the future of browsing, so please do check them out and help them out.</p>

<p>As for the future of this blog, I am considering replacing my main website, mkutay.dev, with this blog, as I really do not have any use for the main site, so when I change it, do not forget to update your bookmarks.</p>
