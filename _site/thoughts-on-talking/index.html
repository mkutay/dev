  <p>Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, wherever you are in the wide world. Today, I was chatting with some of my friends when I realised something, and I want to talk about that.</p>

<p>Speaking with someone other than yourself, in my opinion, allows you to have really in-depth discussions delving into profound topics and things that truly matter, such as what those people genuinely think about life and significant issues that are fundamental to who we are.</p>

<p>However, when you have three, four, or even more people in a chat (both online and face-to-face), there will not be that much deep talking going on. It would mostly touch on surface-level topics, like the weather or what is going on around the world, but it would be breadth and not depth.</p>

<p>I feel like this phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that when you have only two people in a chat, there will be a person talking all the time, and they are going to be one of the chatters, and as such, both of the chatters are going to be involved in the discussion. By contrast, when you have three people and only one person at a time is going to talk, there might be a person who just might not talk, and the other two people would chat. Additionally, there would be a place for chaos where everyone would try to say something, but none of it would be meaningful.</p>
