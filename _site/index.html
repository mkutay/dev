    <p>Hey! It’s 2024 now, woo! It’s been a while since I wrote some stuff here, so this post is going to be all about that—random stuff that happened over the last couple of months. <del>I basically don’t have anything big going on to write.</del></p>

    <p>I did not think that I would say this, but I think it is time to say goodbye to Vivaldi. For those who do not know what <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> is, it is a web browser based on privacy and user power, and do please check it out as it is a great browser for anyone, but, as I will discuss, it is not for me.</p>

    <p>Imagine you are taking an exam—a very long exam, let’s say it is three hours—and you are stuck in a part of the test and cannot pursue further; you just cannot solve anymore questions or problems. If you are allowed, you <em>have</em> to go to the toilet. The main thing about going to the toilet is that, even if you are not going to use it, you will walk to and from the toilet, giving you plenty of time to stretch your legs, arms, and whatever. I believe that this allows you to clear your mind of the stress of the exam by simply walking.</p>

    <p>In Python, there is something that even the creator of Python despises. The <em>thing</em> that I am referring to is the “while, else” statement. Some context is that I was in Cambridge in a computer science course and we had to create some text-based game, and I—unironically—used the forbidden technique, the while else statement. The section of code that uses while else is given below, and for the interested, the full code is at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p>I was in my Turkish literature lesson when we learned about the following poem. Do note that we read the Turkish translation of the poem, which I added after the English version.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone! In this second post of my blog, I am going to explain an error I stumbled upon last week, how I solved it, and asynchronous functions in Javascript.</p>

<p>Last week, while I was improving my <a href="https://www.mkutay.dev/">website</a>, I just couldn’t figure something out. I mean, it wasn’t even a bug because there was nothing that the bug could be on; there was no code that was working in the slightest. I was trying to create an RSS feed extractor on my website so that anyone could look to see if there were any new posts on the Deterministic Blog (hey, we are on that right now) and on the <a href="https://cookieblog.net/">Cookie Blog</a>.</p>

    <p>Hello, and welcome to the Deterministic Blog! I am Mehmet Kutay Bozkurt, in my junior year of high school. 
I fricking love to code and love to do what I want to do. And this blog is what I want to do in my free time.
