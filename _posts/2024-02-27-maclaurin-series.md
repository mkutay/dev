I decided to do a presentation on Maclaurin series for Maths AA HL class, which is in the curriculum.
I made the slides for the presentation using Beamer (with LaTeX), and honestly, it was great. 
By the way, I kind of utilised 3B1B's technique of teaching. Taylor ~~Swift~~ Series (Maclaurin Series), a joke.
